      <span>Students connect is all about exploring notes, messaging students from other courses, department groups, notes photos, interacting with other major students and much more.</span>
  </br>    <span>If you are in the shoes of a freshmen student, you really know how useful this system specially when you are new to college and no new friends yet due to pandemic. This system will serve as a social site specifically designed for interactive sharing of notes for new MSU-IIT students and seniors, faculties as well. </span>
</br>  <span>Finally coming to the point, this website is developed I have no copyright claims see license for templates (creative commons).</span>
  </br>    <span>Students connect is hosted freely, so you'll find it bit slow and many of its features have been removed, such as real-time notifications and updates.</span>
</br>    <span>Designed for students. By students.</span>
